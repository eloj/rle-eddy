# Tips:
#  * You can change a length or hash to something invalid to get a hexdump of the data to inspect.
#  * Inserting a line with '---' will stop testing at that point.
#  * A '-' after the action force-disables roundtrip (re-(de)compressing output) checking.
#  * '@' includes a file for input. Can extract a slice with @[offset:len]
